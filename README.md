**Welcome to my profile!** My name is Jenna Cuzziere, and I am a student at Stonehill College! 

- I am currently studying biology, and in my effort to earn my degree, I have taken an R Programming class. In this class I have gained abilities in understanding the R programming language. 

- In my future, I am planning on furthering my education and my career by becoming a PA! I am very interested in helping people, and I am very interested in the medical field. I also take a special interest in my chemistry classes as I find learning about the world around me to be very fascinating, and I hope to always be able to expand my knowledge.
