# Welcome to my profile!

My name is Jenna Cuzziere, and I am a student at Stonehill College! 

- I am currently studying biology, and in my effort to earn my degree, I have taken an R Programming class. In this class I have gained abilities in understanding the R Programming language. 

- In my future, I am planning on furthering my education and my career by becoming a PA! I am very interested in helping people, and I am very interested in the medical field. I also take a special interest in my chemistry classes as I find learning about the world around me to be very fascinating, and I hope to always be able to expand my knowledge!

In my Portfolio Repository, I have included examples of my work with R Programming. One such example is a Google Drive Tutorial featuring three different functions and their usages. Four other files were added to the repository further displaying my work with R scipt.
